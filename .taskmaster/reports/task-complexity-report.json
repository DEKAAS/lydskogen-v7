      "taskId": 1,
      "taskTitle": "Project Setup and Base Layout",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Project Setup and Base Layout task into 4 subtasks, focusing on: 1) Next.js project initialization with TypeScript, 2) TailwindCSS configuration with custom theme and colors, 3) Base layout component creation with responsive design, and 4) Font and animation setup. Include detailed steps for each subtask.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves setting up the entire project foundation with multiple technologies (Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS). It requires configuration of custom themes, responsive design, and animation libraries. The code example is substantial and covers multiple aspects of the setup. Breaking it into logical groups will make it more manageable."

      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Header/Hero Component",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 2,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the Header/Hero Component task into 2 subtasks: 1) Create the background image with gradient overlay implementation, focusing on responsive behavior and proper image loading, and 2) Implement the content section with title, subtitle, and CTA button with proper styling and animations.",
      "reasoning": "This is a relatively straightforward component with a background image, overlay, and content. The complexity is moderate due to the need for responsive design and proper image handling. Two subtasks would allow focus on the visual background elements separately from the interactive content elements."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Service Section and Card Components",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Split the Service Section and Card Components task into 3 subtasks: 1) Create the data model and types for services, 2) Implement the ServiceCard component with proper styling and interactions, and 3) Build the ServiceSection component that renders multiple cards with responsive grid layout and section styling.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating both data models and multiple components that interact with each other. The ServiceSection needs to handle different background styles and the ServiceCard has multiple interactive elements. The complexity comes from managing the relationship between these components and ensuring they work together properly."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Genre Pages for Music Production",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the Genre Pages implementation into 4 subtasks: 1) Create the data model and dynamic routing for genre pages, 2) Implement the GenreGrid component for displaying genre options, 3) Build the GenrePage template with hero section and content layout, and 4) Create the AudioPlayer component for genre-specific audio examples.",
      "reasoning": "This task has high complexity due to dynamic routing, multiple components, and specialized functionality like audio playback. It requires creating both overview and detail pages with different styling per genre. The animations and transitions add another layer of complexity, as does the need for an audio player component."
    },

      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Artwork Gallery Implementation",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Artwork Gallery Implementation into 3 subtasks: 1) Create the data model and types for artwork items, 2) Implement the GalleryGrid component with responsive layout and animations, and 3) Build the Lightbox component with image display, details, and ordering functionality.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating a gallery with lightbox functionality, which requires state management for selected items and animations for transitions. The lightbox needs to handle user interactions like closing and ordering. The responsive grid layout adds complexity to ensure proper display across devices."
    },

      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Artist Page with Pricing Plans",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the Artist Page implementation into 3 subtasks: 1) Create the data models for pricing plans and FAQ items, 2) Implement the PricingPlans component with tier selection and visual highlighting, and 3) Build the AnimatedAccordion component for the FAQ section with proper animations and interactions.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires creating multiple interactive components with complex state management. The pricing plan selection needs visual feedback, and the accordion for FAQs requires animation states. The data models are also fairly complex with multiple properties that need to be displayed correctly."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Combo Offer Module",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 2,
      "expansionPrompt": "Split the Combo Offer Module into 2 subtasks: 1) Implement the service selection interface with visual feedback and state management, and 2) Create the selected services display with contact CTA and responsive design for mobile devices.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating an interactive module with state management for selected services. The complexity comes from managing the selection state and providing visual feedback. The responsive design considerations, especially the mobile sticky button, add another layer of complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "About and Contact Section",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the About and Contact Section into 3 subtasks: 1) Create the About section with content and animations, 2) Implement the contact form with validation and submission handling, and 3) Build the success/error state handling and responsive layout for both sections.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves form validation, state management for form submission, and animations. The contact form needs proper validation for all fields and handling of submission states. The responsive layout needs to work well on all devices, and the animations add complexity to the implementation."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Footer Component",
      "complexityScore": 3,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 1,
      "expansionPrompt": "Implement the Footer Component as a single task, including contact information, organization details, quick links, and social media icons with proper responsive layout and styling.",
      "reasoning": "This is a relatively simple component with static content and basic styling. While it has multiple sections, they don't require complex interactions or state management. The responsive layout is straightforward, and there are no complex animations or state changes to manage."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 10,
      "taskTitle": "Navigation and Page Routing",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Navigation and Page Routing task into 4 subtasks: 1) Implement the Navbar component with sticky behavior and responsive design, 2) Create the mobile menu with animations and toggle functionality, 3) Set up smooth scrolling to page sections and handling of hash links, and 4) Configure Next.js dynamic routing and page structure for the entire site.",
      "reasoning": "This task has high complexity as it ties together the entire application's navigation system. It involves state management for scroll position and mobile menu, event handling for smooth scrolling, and complex routing logic. The interactions between the router and scroll behavior add significant complexity, as does the need to handle both internal section links and page navigation."
